	/// enabling a reflection-free serialization path under trimming and native AOT.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// Domain events are consumer types the framework cannot source-generate, so with no resolver the store
	/// serializes them through the reflection-based <see cref="System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer"/>. That works
	/// under the JIT, but a native-AOT application published with reflection-based serialization disabled has
	/// no reflection path to fall back on and the first append fails. Set this to a
	/// <see cref="System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerContext"/> (or any
	/// <see cref="System.Text.Json.Serialization.Metadata.IJsonTypeInfoResolver"/>) covering those types to
	/// remove that dependency.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The stored wire format does not vary with this setting. The resolver supplies type metadata only; the
	/// property naming policy, string-enum representation and null handling are the store's own and are
	/// applied to whichever resolver is in use, so events written with a resolver are byte-identical to events
	/// written without one and remain readable by a host configured either way.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Metadata values are typed <see cref="object"/> and are therefore written as their runtime type. Declare
	/// each closed value type the application actually stores -- <c>string</c>, <c>int</c>, <c>bool</c> and so
	/// on. Do not declare <c>Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</c> as a shortcut: it compiles and then throws on
	/// the values it was meant to cover.
	/// </para>
	/// </remarks>
	/// <value>The consumer's event type-info resolver, or <see langword="null"/> to serialize through
