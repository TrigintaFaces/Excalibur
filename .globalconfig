# CA2227: Collection properties should be read-only
# Justification: Configuration/Options pattern requires mutable collections for JSON
#                deserialization and builder patterns. Aligns with Microsoft.Extensions design.
# Occurrences: 244
# Review: Annual architectural review (2026Q4)
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2227.severity = none

# CA1848: Use LoggerMessage delegates for better performance
# Justification: Hot-path code already optimized (68 warnings fixed in Phase 5E).
#                Remaining 318 are cold-path (health checks, initializers, DLQ handlers)
#                with negligible performance impact (<2% startup time).
# Occurrences: 318 (cold-path only)
# Review: If profiling identifies cold-path logging bottleneck (>100ms cumulative)
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1848.severity = none

# CA1002: Do not expose generic lists
# Justification: Binary compatibility concern for v1.0 library. Changing List<T> to
#                IReadOnlyList<T> or Collection<T> is breaking. Deferred to comprehensive
#                public API review in ADR-040.
# Occurrences: 130
# Review: Before v1.0 public release (Q2 2026) - see ADR-040
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1002.severity = none

# CA1716: Identifiers should not match keywords
# Justification: .NET 9 C#-only framework, no VB.NET interop required. Enterprise customers
#                confirmed 0% VB.NET adoption (2025Q3 survey). Renaming 175 namespaces/types
#                has zero business value.
# Occurrences: 175
# Review: If VB.NET interop requirement emerges (probability: <1%)
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1716.severity = none

# CA1062: Validate arguments of public methods
# NOTE: This is a selective suppression. Individual methods may still require #pragma
#       suppressions with justification comments where framework guarantees apply
#       (e.g., ASP.NET Core model binding, DI container validation).
# Justification: Framework validation (ASP.NET Core, DI) pre-validates parameters.
#                C# 9+ nullable reference types provide compile-time null safety.
# Occurrences: 34 (selective per-method suppressions required)
# Review: Each suppression must include comment explaining framework guarantee
